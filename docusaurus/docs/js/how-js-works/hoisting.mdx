# Hoisting

<br />

Hoisting is part of the creation (memory allocation) phase of the execution context.

During memory allocation phase, hositing is responsible for **allocating memory** for variables and functions and setting their initial values.

<br />

### How hoisting works

During memory allocation phase any variable (including functions) declared with `var` is allocated memory with value `undefined` and functions declared with `function` keyword are allocated memory with the whole function definition.

```js showLineNumbers
console.log(a); // a is accessible here but its value is undefined

foo(); // foo is accessible here because of hoisting

var a = 10;

function foo() {
  var b = 20;
  console.log(a + b);
}
```

<br />
:::warning 
Function expressions are not hoisted
```js showLineNumbers
bar(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'bar' before initialization

var bar = function () {
  console.log("bar");
};
```
:::

<br />

### undefined vs not defined (ReferenceError)

A variable's value is `undefined` when it has been declared but not assigned any value yet.

`not defined` means that the variable has not been declared. In this case you will get a `ReferenceError`.

```js showLineNumbers
console.log(a); // undefined because a is hoisted with value undefined
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined

var a = 10;
```

| Variable | Present in memory? | Value       |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **a**    | Yes                | `undefined` |
| **b**    | No                 | -           |

<br />

### Hoisting with let and const

```js showLineNumbers
console.log(a); // undefined because a is hoisted with value undefined
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
console.log(c); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization

let a = 10;
var b = 20;
const c = 30;
```
