# Doubts

1. When exactly does execution context's creation phase happen for both global and function execution contexts? During compilation?

2. Global lexical environment vs global scope (window). 
	- When is each of them created, why are they used? 
	- How important are they both in modern module based JS? 
	- Why global scope in dev tools is same as window and why it contains a window key in itself?

3. Script and module scopes (see test.html example). 
	- If there are 2 scripts in single html file, which variables will be shared between them and which will not? (also explore this when both normal and module type script present)
	- Does script scope actually exist or is it just a way to show scope handling by dev tools (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40685277/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-script-scope)
	- Does module scope actually exist? 
	- Are they also visible in a simple react application? 

4. Check and document which all scopes are created in below scenarious:
   - Vanills JS (chrome snippets)
   - JS script in html
   - JS script with type="module" in html
   - Simple react app
   - MMT cabs react app

5. Parts of lexical enviroment in detail
	 - Environment record (declarative vs object environment record)
	 - Reference to the outer environment

6. How **this** is different in module vs regular script?
