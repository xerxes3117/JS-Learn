### How let and const work

**let** and **const** are stored in a seprate memory space than **var**.

```javascript showLineNumbers
let a = 1;
const b = 2;
var c = 3;

{
  let a = 4;
  const b = 5;
  var c = 6;
  console.log(a); // 4
  console.log(b); // 5
  console.log(c); // 6
}

console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
console.log(c); // 6
```

If you run the above code, you will see the following in dev tools:

There are 2 copies of **a** and **b** (in block and script scopes), but only one copy of **c** (in global scope). This is why **a** and **b** are not affected by the changes made in the block scope, but **c** is changed to **6**.

<img
  src={blockScope}
  alt="Scope"
  width="700"
  style={{ border: "0.2px solid grey" }}
/>

<br />
<br />

:::warning
Even though **let** and **var** are stored in a separate memory space (let is stored in "script" scope i.e. DER while var is stored in global scope i.e. OER), you can't redeclare a **let** variable in the same scope using **var**:
```javascript
let a = 1;
var a = 2; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
```
