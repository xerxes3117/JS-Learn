# Immutability

### What is meant by immutability?
???

### Memory allocation in primitives vs reference types
#### Primitive types
```javascript
let a = 10;
var b = a;
b = 20;
console.log(a); // 10 
console.log(b); // 20
```

#### Reference types
```javascript
let obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 20
};

let obj2 = obj;

obj2.age = 30;

console.log(obj.age); // 30
console.log(obj2.age); // 30
```
